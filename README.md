# Multi-architecture k9s builds

This repository is pretty much just a workflow to create multi-architecture
builds (armv6, armv7, arm64, amd64) of [derailed/k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s).

The k9s repository is added as a submodule so that pull requests are created
for upstream updates by Dependabot.
